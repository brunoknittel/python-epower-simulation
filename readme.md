To Do
[ ] Define interfaces for power consumption input
[ ] Define interfaces for power production input
[ ] Define simulation interface for power storage
[ ] Implement power production from electricty provider
[ ] Implement power production based on solar surface, angle and a solar power provider info
[ ] Generate report
[ ] Configuration of the simulation using a configuration file

Purpose
I wanted to know the impact of photovolta√Øc panels, house battery and even some
automation to make things run when sun power is here (e.g. dryer or washing machine).
My house has some mean to record it's electricity usage per hour, and I wanted to use this data
as a basis for the simulation.

Simulation configuration
The first thing you'll need is a simulation configuration file. It's in JSON format
and describes what you want to simulate.


Running the simulation
Once you have this file, running the simulation is as simple as:
eprodsimulation --config=<path to config file>
